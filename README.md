# Hey ðŸ‘‹

I've been enjoying web development using React and Next js for the longest time, and typescript revolutionised my thinking when writing code. Then I studied Go, and fell in love with it. The standard library is great and, dare I say it, I really like and enjoy writing the syntax.

I'm on the lookout for a role in backend development, prefarrably using Go, but I would be open to Python and Node too, or if you're rolling out Bun JS, I'd be interested in getting to know that, too!

Do I sound like a good fit? Let's talk!
